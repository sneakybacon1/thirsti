		<p style="font-family: 'roboto';">We are not like other water brands you see. We don't behave like them, act like them or taste like them.<br></br>

Even our story is unique. It began in the early 90's, on one of the Normandien farms, situated at the foothills of the Klein Drakensberg in Northern Natal, way before people were selling bottled natural spring water commercially.
<br></br>
We don't have to sell you a pretty picture, because the site of where our source is located is genuinely something to behold and breathtaking. Luckily we don’t have to sell you on the taste of our water either, because we just know that it tastes better than anything else out there and history has given us an indication of this already.
<br></br>
You see, way back in the early 90's – an extremely industrious woman named Anneriet Van Niekerk discovered a special kind of water that had been hidden from humans since the dawn of time. And it came in the form of a natural spring, a fountain of purity nestled amongst the indigenous forests on the slopes of the Klein Drakensberg. This water was untouched and contained a flowing charm and a taste that only nature could master.
<br></br>
Upon her first taste, Anneriet knew she had found something magical, something she wanted to share with the rest of the world. It was at this moment that she began her journey of bottling water.
<br></br>
Buying bottled water was unheard of at the time, but the refreshingly unique taste of this water soon became a necessity for those living in the nearby community. So much so, that Anneriet was able to sustain her livelihood from the sales she made selling this bottled spring water.
<br></br>
A few years later the Van Niekerk family sold their farm and the distribution of this water came to a halt for many years.
<br></br>
One day whilst driving along the farm on a Sunday afternoon, the new owner of the farm noticed a truck with two large barrels of water. He drove up to the people in this vehicle and asked them what they were doing. A man then told him how he travelled here every weekend to get the water that came from this spring.
<br></br>
Confused, the owner of the farm asked why they would travel so far just for water? Surely there were other, easier means of getting water? The man smiled, telling the farm owner that this water was special with a taste like no other.
<br></br>
At first the farm owner thought this was crazy, after all water is just water, isn't it? The man then gave him a taste of this water and at that point the farm owner understood why the man had travelled so far. The water could quench a thirst like nothing else on earth. It was from this encounter where the idea of bottling this natural spring water was born once again.
<br></br>
So much so, that we have subsequently established that the spring is able to sustainably yield millions and millions of litres of natural spring water a year. We've also invested in a 6000m2 bottling plant at source to ensure the plant can currently bottle 40 million litres of spring water per annum, as well as implemented a fleet of trucks to ensure sound national distribution so that the magical taste of our natural spring water can be shared with the rest of South Africa.
